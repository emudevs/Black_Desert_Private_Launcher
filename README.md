# Black_Desert_Private_Launcher
I got annoyed at having to use a batch file to start the client so i made a simple launcher and decided to put it up here for you guys to use.

What it looks like!

If you are upgrading from the older versions and have already created your accounts you will just need to add a space to the front of your password.

If on the other hand this is the first time you are downloading/using this launcher just put in the correct password (no extra space at the front)

# install notes
extract into the main client folder (has bin, bin64 and paz folders)
and thats it run it and fill in details then login
can save login/password by clicking remember me
password is hidden behind dots but is not encrypted
loads the service.ini file each time and creates a new one with server ip/port when you click login

# update notes
i will not be updating this as it does not need it - apparently i was wrong! files/links updated.

V2 replaces username with email address to stop users creating accounts that will not have a contactable email address - previous version created an account with username and no email address (not that i needed it to do that since i have access to my LAN server but someone else might need it so here it is)

v3 removes the space from between the login name and password (as it was it was creating passwords with that extra space at the front) special thanks to @Lautaro for pointing that out and explaining it to me a second time 

v4 made the email textbox longer for a larger email address if needed and setup comments in source files to help newer programmers learn a little bit about the functions i have created
